Sentinel v2 configuration.

Phase 0 scope was connection settings only. Phase 1 adds `data_dir`, the
path to the repo-root `data/` folder the ingestion pipeline reads raw files
from -- it lives outside backend_v2/ (and outside the Docker build context;
see docker-compose.yml / scripts/run_ingest.py for how it's bind-mounted).
No weights, thresholds, or scoring config yet -- those get ported (and
reconsidered) once business logic phases start. See
backend/app/core/config.py for the current provisional values this will
eventually need to account for.
